    <p id="paragraph1">
        My name is Biruk Taye. I'm currently a student at Bahir Dar University. 
        I'm passionate about coding, technology, and learning new things. 
        In my leisure time, I enjoy reading, playing sports, and exploring new hobbies. 
        <br><br>
        I believe in continuous self-improvement and always strive to stay updated with the latest trends in technology. 
        My journey in coding started in high school, and since then, I've been captivated by the endless possibilities it offers. 
        Aside from academics, playing soccer and basketball keeps me active, while delving into different genres of books broadens my perspective on various topics.
